# SundaySim
A CMS build upon Laravel

This repository contains the completed project for this courseâ€”a simple content management system.

The source for this application is mainly located within the app directory. Within here we have various directories each responsible for a particular piece of the application.

To get a local copy of the application working you can follow the instructions below (assuming you're on a *nix machine):

run the following commands from your terminal:

$ composer install
$ php artisan migrate
$ php artisan db:seed
$ npm install
$ gulp
If you'd like to use Artisan to serve your application you can run the following command:

$ php artisan serve
This will then serve the application to localhost:8000.

Otherwise use Homestead to serve the application.
